# spotifyProcessing
You can use this code to process your spotify data!

## How to download your data from spotify:
Go to: https://www.spotify.com/ca-en/account/privacy/ to request your data from spotify

## Packages I use:
Make sure you have: 
  - Pandas (from: https://pandas.pydata.org/)
  - json (built in: https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_json.asp)
  - numpy (from: https://numpy.org/)
  - prettytable (from: https://pypi.org/project/prettytable/)

## To use:
Once you have your data, open the zip file and put it in the same folder as the code:

cwd: 
  - code
  - folder of listening history: /Spotify Extended Streaming History
The code should automatically import all your data if you've followed this convention

Your total listening time, top 5 songs and top 5 artists (by # of plays and play time) will be printed
